# Web Profile WinXP

Created with the amazing [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/).

## Why?

Because I'm better at coding than doing UI Design, so copying the UI from Windows XP and functionalities sounded like a fun challenge.

### Special Thanks

[ShizukuIchi's WinXP](https://github.com/ShizukuIchi/winXP) for a lot of cool CSS tricks that I used in this project.

[XP.css](https://botoxparty.github.io/XP.css/) helped me with a few small CSS things.
